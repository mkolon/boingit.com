# About page

**boingit.com** is a headless website with a silly name used by me ([Matt Kolon](https://mattkolon.com/))
for many different purposes. I put files here for students and others of various
clients, including exercise elements, models, spreadsheets, links, etc. Boing! 
It changes all the time. 

There's never anything proprietary or confidential here.

If you want something that was here before, [give me a shout](mailto:matt@kolon.org)
and I'll try to help you out. But the best thing to do is just to grab it when you 
see it the first time!
