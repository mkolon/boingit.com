Taking inspiration from [Carl](https://carlkolon.com/2021/07/31/websitejekyll.html), I decided to remake boingit.com using [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). If you were here before, well, it looks pretty different now, but it's a big improvement in terms of manageability and hopefully ease of use for students and the other folks who use it. [Shoot me a line](mailto:matt@hill.com) if you have questions or comments about the site or its contents. Thanks, /matt.
